This is a Japanese open source project designed to make it easy for beginners to participate. <br>
Follow the tutorial and experience your first contribution!

We'll be happy to help you with your first pull request ‚úåÔ∏è

<br>

## Introduction

This project is a Japanese tutorial to learn how to use Git/GitHub in practice and how to collaborate in open source!

### Who is this for?

- Beginners who want to learn how to use Git/GitHub in practice
- People who are interested in open source but don't know how to contribute
- Or those who want to improve their skills while enjoying collaboration through more contributions

### What is the purpose of this project?

- To experience actual collaborative development using GitHub, which is difficult to learn on one's own

- To teach everyone how to contribute to open source projects with confidence

- And to help developers who love the open source culture connect with each other

<br>

<details>
<summary>What is open source anyway‚ùì‚ùì</summary>

[Open source](https://opensource.guide/ja/starting-a-project/#what-is-open-source-and-why-to-do-it) is:

> When a project is open source, it means that anyone is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose.

>
In most cases, open source projects are open to anyone!

**Contributing to open source projects is a great way to improve your skills by collaborating with other developers. **

If you're not interested in open source and wondering if it's worth the effort,<br>
check out: [Why contribute to open source? ](https://opensource.guide/ja/how-to-contribute/#%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BD%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AB%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%93%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E7%90%86%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AF)
</details>

> **Become an open source contributor in 8 easy steps** :sunglasses:

- If you need help, ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/first-contributions-ja/first-contributions-ja.github.io/discussions)!
- If you think there's an improvement you could make to this project, report it in [Issues](https://github.com/first-contributions-ja/first-contributions-ja.github.io/issues)!

Every little bit counts üôå

---

### Setting up:

- If you don't have a GitHub account, [Sign up](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) to create one.
- And if necessary, we recommend that you first complete the [GitHub Hello World tutorial](https://docs.github.com/ja/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for complete beginners.
- If an access token is not set in place of a password, errors may occur when cloning, etc.
- In that case, please refer to [Setting a GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/ja/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

---

### Step 1: Fork this repository

- Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the project page on GitHub (this page) to fork this repository.

<p align="center">
<img height=150px src="/docs/images/fork-button.png">
</p>

- Then click the "Create fork" button.

- You can leave the "Repository name", "Description", "Copy the `main` branch only" and other items at their initial settings!

<p align="center">
<img height=400px src="/docs/images/create-fork-button.png">
</p>

> [!TIP]
> This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account üëç

---

### Step 2: Clone to your local machine

You can also edit the files on GitHub, but<br>
to experience a more common workflow, copy the forked repository to your local machine.

- Go to the page of your forked repository on GitHub, click the green "Code" button, and copy the HTTPS URL.

- The URL should look something like this:`https://github.com/<your account name>/first-contributions-ja.github.io.git`

<p align="center">
<img height=300px src="/docs/images/code-clone.png">
</p>

- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

- For example, to clone to your desktop, you can use the following command:
```
cd desktop
```
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine with the following command:
```
git clone clone URL you copied earlier
```

> [!TIP]
> This copies the repository to your local machine and you can now work on it locally üíª

---

### Step 3: Create a working branch

<p align="center">
<img height=80px src="/docs/images/clone-to-desktop.png">
</p>

- Use the following command to move into the repository directory:
```
cd first-contributions-ja.github.io
```
- Use the following command to install the packages required for this project:
```
npm install
```
<br>
<details>
<summary>Note: What is npm install?</summary>

<br>

**If you have Node.js installed, you can run the `npm install` command to install all the libraries required for this project at once. **

#### What you can do after `npm install`

- **Start a local server and check the display in the browser**
- After executing the `npm run dev` command, you can check by clicking the displayed URL
- **Automatically check and format the code when committing**
- Executed using a library called husky
- It is executed automatically, so there is no need to execute any commands or do any work

<br>

For more information about the `npm install` command, please refer to [here](https://qiita.com/sugurutakahashi12345/items/3cc49926faeaf25d3051)!

#### üößNote) If Node.js is not installed on your local machine, the `npm install` command will cause an error.

In that case, there are **two ways** to deal with it.

- **Skip the `npm install` step. **
- You can get a minimal contribution experience without this step, so if it's difficult for you, feel free to skip it.
- I'd like to know how many people have trouble with this step, so it would be very helpful if you could report to the pull request that "`npm install` didn't work."
- **Install Node.js. **
- For installation instructions, please refer to the following sites.
- [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en) / [How to install Node.js (macOS) Progate](https://prog-8.com/docs/nodejs-env) / [How to install Node.js (Windows) Progate](https://prog-8.com/docs/nodejs-env-win)
- If you want to know more about Node.js, please refer to [What is Node.js? Why is everyone using it? Qiita](https://qiita.com/non_cal/items/a8fee0b7ad96e67713eb).
- If you're interested in web/JavaScript development, this is a great time to install it üòé

</details>

<br>

- Next, create a new branch to separate your work from the `main` branch of your project.

- You can use the following command: `git switch -c <branch name>`

- The **branch name** should be something meaningful related to the work you're going to be doing.
So it will look like this:
```
git switch -c add-yourname
```
- **üößCaution**)
- Don't forget to replace `yourname` with your handle
- Enter the branch name in half-width alphanumeric characters, without hiragana, kanji, or spaces
- ‚ùå: Ogino Chihiro, Ogino Chihiro, Ogino Chihiro
- Example:
```
git switch -c add-oginochihiro
```

> [!TIP]
> Now you're ready to make changes without directly affecting the project's `main` repository üçµ

---

### Step 4: Make changes

- To get started, open the cloned folder in your favorite code editor, such as VSCode.
- Before making any changes, make sure you are working in the branch you created in the previous step!
- You can check which branch you are in with the following command:
```
git status
```
- Now it's time to make some changes to your Contributors.json file.
- **Copy and paste the following code into the "end of the list" section of your Contributors.json file. **
```
,
{
"name": "Your handle",
"github": "Your GitHub account URL",
"favoriteColor": "Your favorite color code",
"favoriteEmoji": "Your favorite emoji"
}
```

<p align="center">
<img height=300px src="/docs/images/copy-and-paste-code.png">
</p>

- Then replace the pasted text with your own text.
- :art: Please refer to the following sites: [Emoji List](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/), [Primary Color Dictionary](https://www.colordic.org), [Traditional Japanese Colors](https://nipponcolors.com)
- For example, if you replace everything, it will look like this:
```
<!-- After change -->
~~
},
{
"name": "oginochihiro",
"github": "https://github.com/first-contributions-ja",
"favoriteColor": "#ffffff",
"favoriteEmoji": "üêâ"
}
]
```

---

### Step 5: Commit the changes

- Go to the terminal again and use the following command to commit the changes to your local repository.
- Don't forget to replace `yourname` with your handle name.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add yourname to contributors"
```

> [!TIP]
> This will record the changes you made to the Contributors.json file üìù

---

### Step 6: Push your changes

- Push your changes to your forked remote repository:
```
git push origin HEAD
```

> [!TIP]
> This will push your previous commit (your local changes) to your remote repository on GitHub üëæ

---

### Step 7: Create a pull request (PR)

- Go to the page of the remote repository you forked on GitHub (`https://github.com/youraccount/first-contributions-ja.github.io`).

- Click the "Compare & pull request" button at the top.

<p align="center">
<img height=150px src="/docs/images/compare-pull-request.png">
</p>

- Then, after checking the following, click the "Create pull request" button.

- Just to be sure, make sure that you are going from the `add-yourname` branch of your repository to the `main` branch of first-contributions-js!

- Leave the title as it is and leave the description blank!

<p align="center">
<img height=500px src="/docs/images/create-pull-request.png">
</p>

> [!TIP]
> This will request that the changes you made in your fork be pushed back to the repository you forked from üéÅ

---

### Step 8: Review and respond to feedback

Your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers.

- It is normal for the reviewer to request changes in your PR. If this happens, just make the changes and accept the changes.
- In that case, just go back to the same working branch as before, make the requested changes, and then just [commit your changes](#step-5Commit your changes) and push again.
- The PR will be automatically updated with the new push.

Most reviews happen within 24 hours, but there can be a delay of a few days. Please be patient ‚òï

---

### Finish:üéâ

- Once your pull request is approved, your changes will be merged into the main project.

Good job! <br>
